# number-recognition
A self-made neuron network library to do machine learning.<br/>
OpenCV is needed.<br/>
The model will auto detect the numbers in the image, divide them and recognize them.<br/>
No machine learning library is needend. All neurons and networks are self made, so the efficience is not very high.<br/>
The main purpose of the project is to learn the basics of the machine learing and the structure of neurons.<br/>
The results of the project can be seen like this:<br/>
